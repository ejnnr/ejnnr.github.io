            Proving things for object that have a lot of structure can be harder
  than for object with less structure, simply because the tree of possible
  proofs is much wider. This is probably why trying to prove a more general
  case is sometimes a helpful strategy.

  but it&#39;s hard to pin down what it is exactly. I discuss several different perspectives
  for thinking about it.
