I'm translating my personal blog & website from Hugo to a custom website with Svelte and Tailwind.
Svelte, SvelteKit, mdsvex, and Tailwind are already set up.
The blog posts will be stored as Markdown in the `src/routes/post` directory,
with one blog post per subdirectory. Each blog post is in the `+page.md` file.

The website should be fast, responsive and mobile-friendly, but not over-engineered.

Use pnpm as package manager.
