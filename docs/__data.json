It seems to have a reputation as being difficult to understand and use, which is completely backwards in my view: the reason `einsum` is great is precisely because it is *easier* to use and reason about than the alternatives. So this post tries to set the record straight and show how simple `einsum` really is.\n  ",[],"/post/einsum","einsum",{"title":17,"date":18,"summary":19,"tags":20,"path":22,"slug":23},"Distributions Part II: What can we do with distributions?","2022-03-05T23:00:00.000Z","  As promised in part I, we can do a lot of the same things with Schwartz\n  distributions as with classical functions.
