I'm a Computer Science PhD student at UC Berkeley,
advised by Prof. Stuart Russell, and part
of the [Center for Human-Compatible AI](https://humancompatible.ai/).
I am working on how to align powerful future AI systems with human values,
to reduce the [existential risk posed by AI](https://futureoflife.org/background/benefits-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/).
