I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.
My goal is to have a positive impact on the world by making sure that AI will be aligned with humanityâ€™s interests.

I'm currently doing a research internship at the [Center for Human-Compatible AI](https://humancompatible.ai/),
where I work on interpreting reward models.
I have also done work on [equivariant deep learning](/publication/steerable-pdos) and
[graph-based segmentation](/publication/karger).
