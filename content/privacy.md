This website uses [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) to count page views,
which doesn't collect any personal information. More precisely, only the following information
is collected:
- The `Referer` header
- The name of the country and region (based on the IP address)
- A hash of IP address, User-Agent, and a random salt (to identify continuous sessions,
  deleted after 8 hours)

None of this information is shared with any third parties.

Because this page is hosted with Github Pages, Github may log visits, including IP adresses as per their [privacy policy](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).

Contact me at [erik@ejenner.com](mailto:erik@ejenner.com) for any questions.
