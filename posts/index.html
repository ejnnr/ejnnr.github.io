          The bias-variance tradeoff is a key idea in machine learning. But I&rsquo;ll
argue that we know surprisingly little about it: when does it hold?
How does it relate to the Double Descent phenomenon? And what do we
even formally mean when we talk about it?

          Spherical harmonics are ubiquitous in math and physics, in part because
they naturally appear as solutions to several problems; in particular they
are the eigenfunctions of the spherical Laplacian and the irreducible
representations of SO(3). But why should the solutions to these problems
be the same? And why are they called spherical harmonics?

          Several new architectures for neural networks, such as Neural ODEs and
deep equlibirum models can be understood as replacing classical layers
that explicitly specify how to compute the output with implicit layers.
These layers describe which conditions the output should specify but
leave the actual computation up to some solver that can be chosen arbitrarily.
This post contains a brief introduction to the main ideas behind implicit layers.

          L1 regularization is famous for leading to sparse optima, in contrast to
L2 regularization. There are several ways of understanding this but I&rsquo;ll
argue that it&rsquo;s really all about one fact: the L1 norm has a singularity
at the origin, while the L2 norm does not. And this is not just true
for L1 and L2 regularization: singularities are always necessary to get sparse weights.

          Proving things for object that have a lot of structure can be harder
than for object with less structure, simply because the tree of possible
proofs is much wider. This is probably why trying to prove a more general
case is sometimes a helpful strategy.

          Variational autoencoders are usually introduced as a probabilistic extension of autoencoders
with regularization. An alternative view is that the encoder arises naturally as a tool
for efficiently training the decoder. This is the perspective I take in this post, deriving
VAEs without assuming an autoencoder architecture a priori.

          &ldquo;Structure&rdquo; is a concept that keeps popping up when thinking about mathematics
but it&rsquo;s hard to pin down what it is exactly. I discuss several different perspectives
for thinking about it.

          The Karger-Stein algorithm is an improvement over Karger&rsquo;s beautiful contraction
algorithm for minimum graph cuts. In this post, I show how it finds the perfect
tradeoff between finding a mincut with high probability and finding it quickly.
In the course of doing so, we will also understand where the somewhat opaque
factor of sqrt(2) comes from.

          For people who want to discount the future, special relativity creates
some challenges. There are different ways to handle those but none
seem completely satisfactory which may be yet another argument against
discounting pure utilities.
