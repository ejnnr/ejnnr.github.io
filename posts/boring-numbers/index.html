      <p>Informally, Chaitin&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem states that there is a constant \(L\),
such that we can&rsquo;t prove the Kolmogorov complexity of any specific bit string to
be larger than \(L\).
We <em>can</em> of course prove that there are infinitely many bit strings with higher complexity
than \(L\) &ndash; but we can&rsquo;t name a single one!</p>
<p>John Baez calls this constant \(L\) the <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/surprises.html">complexity barrier</a>. And surprisingly,
he argues that it is probably very low (on the order of a few thousand bits for reasonable
encoding schemes)!</p>
<p>At least to me, this is a pretty amazing fact. Consider all the material available on the
internet for instance: everything ever written online, all the videos and images,
and binaries for every computer program out there. &ldquo;Obviously&rdquo; we can&rsquo;t just write
a Python program of a few kilobytes that outputs all of this, &hellip; right?
Well, I&rsquo;m pretty sure we can&rsquo;t, but somewhat incredibly, there&rsquo;s no proof of that!</p>
<p>Take a moment to be properly astonished by this result because the aim of this post
is to make it as obvious as possible. We&rsquo;ll get there soon enough, but first let&rsquo;s
look at some fun paradoxa.</p>
<h2 id="there-are-no-boring-numbers-dot-dot-dot">There are no boring numbers &hellip;</h2>
<p>The follwing &ldquo;paradox&rdquo; is quite famous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume there was an uninteresting natural number. Then the smallest such number
would be interesting &ndash; because it&rsquo;s the smallest uninteresting number,
that&rsquo;s quite an interesting property!
This is a contradiction, so there can be no uninteresting natural numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can formalize it as follows: we have some boolean &ldquo;boringness&rdquo; property, call it \(P\), defined over
natural numbers. So \(P(n)\) just means &ldquo;\(n\) is boring&rdquo;.
Being the lowest boring number is itself interesting:
\[P\left(\min_{P(n)} n\right)\quad \text{is false}\]
This is self-contradictory if there are any \(n\) such that \(P(n)\),
so no natural numbers can have property \(P\).</p>
<h2 id="dot-dot-dot-and-every-number-can-be-described-in-13-words-or-less">&hellip; and every number can be described in 13 words or less</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a arguably more interesting variation of this paradox: let \(P_k(n)\) mean
&ldquo;\(n\) cannot be described in fewer than \(k\) words&rdquo;. Consider then the description
&ldquo;the smallest natural number which cannot be described in fewer than 14 words&rdquo;.
In our notation, this would be
\[\min_{P_{14}(n)} n\]
However, this description is only 13 words long, so
\[P_{14}\left(\min_{P_{14}(n)} n\right)\quad \text{is false}\]
which is a contradiction if such a number exists. Therefore, every number can be described
in at most 13 words.</p>
<p>This seems suspicious: while there are many 13-word phrases, there&rsquo;s still only
a finite number of them<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. So there aren&rsquo;t enough short
descriptions to go around for each natural number to get one.</p>
<h2 id="there-are-arbitrarily-complex-strings-dot-dot-dot">There are arbitrarily complex strings &hellip;</h2>
<p>Of course the problem is that &ldquo;cannot be described in fewer than \(k\) words&rdquo; is
not a well-defined property because there is no unambiguous mapping from English
descriptions to numbers.</p>
<p>But what if we replace English by a formal language to circumvent this issue? For example,
a Turing machine without any input either halts and outputs a number (in the form
of a bit string), or it runs forever. If we fix an encoding for Turing machines,
any Turing machine has a length, so we can define
\(P_k(n)\) as &ldquo;\(n\) is not the output of any halting Turing machine with length less than \(k\)&rdquo;. Or more briefly:
&ldquo;the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%5Fcomplexity">Kolmogorov complexity</a> of \(n\) is at least \(k\)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s repeat our argument with Turing machines instead of natural language.
We need to define a program that outputs \(\min_{P_k(n)} n\) while being itself
shorter than \(k\). Given a subroutine that checks whether \(P_k(n)\) for arbitrary \(n\),
we could simply iterate over \(n = 1, 2, \ldots\) until we find one such that
\(P_k(n)\) and then output that. If such an \(n\) existed, this program would
output \(\min_{P_k(n)} n\), so by the same argument as before, there can&rsquo;t
be any \(n\) with complexity higher than \(k\) &hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; which can&rsquo;t be right, because just as with natural language descriptions,
there are only finitely many programs of length \(\leq k\), but infinitely many
bit strings.</p>
<p>This time, the issue is the phrase &ldquo;Given a subroutine &hellip;&quot;: \(P_k\) is
undecidable, so this subroutine unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t exist<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Or fortunately, if you value the consistency of mathematics.</p>
<p>In essense, the problem is this: in English, the smallest number with a simple property
can be described in few words because you only need to describe the property and a few
additional words. But the same is not true for Kolmogorov complexity <em>if the property isn&rsquo;t decidable</em>.</p>
<p>For any decidable property, the argument works: the smallest number with that property
will have low Kolmogorov complexity (where &ldquo;low&rdquo; means &ldquo;not much larger than the
complexity of the property&rdquo;). Let&rsquo;s see what we can get by applying that insight.</p>
<h2 id="dot-dot-dot-but-not-provably-complex-ones">&hellip; but not provably complex ones!</h2>
<p>This post is supposed to be about Chaitin&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem, so we&rsquo;d better
connect all of this talk about paradoxa and complexity to that.
The only missing ingredient is to consider <em>provably</em> large
complexities, rather than just large complexities as before.</p>
<p>This means \(P_k(n)\) will now be &ldquo;\(n\) encodes a proof that some specific bit
string has Kolmogorov complexity higher than \(k\)&rdquo;. We need some system of
logic to make &ldquo;proof&rdquo; well-defined and an encoding scheme of proofs as natural
numbers but we&rsquo;ll ignore that since our goal is just to gain intuition.</p>
<p>This new \(P_k\) is clearly decidable: we just need to check whether \(n\) is a valid encoding
of a proof and whether that proof shows that some specific number has Kolmogorov
complexity higher than \(k\).</p>
<p>This program has length \(\log k\) (to encode \(k\))
plus some constant. As we saw, this means that \(\min_{P_k(n)} n\) also has Kolmogorov
complexity at most \(\log k\) (up to a constant): we can iterate over \(n\) and return
the first one for which \(P_k(n)\) holds.</p>
<p>So far there&rsquo;s no contradiction: \(n\) proves that the Kolmogorov complexity of
<em>some specific number</em>, call if \(M(n)\), is larger than \(k\). And we&rsquo;ve only seen
that the Kolmogorov complexity of \(\min_{P_k(n)} n\) is low. But of course
\(M\) is itself computable and in fact by a pretty short program
(which just looks at what \(n\) proves). So \(M_k := M\left(\min_{P_k(n)} n\right)\)
also has a small complexity, more precisely:
\[K(M_k) \leq \log k + \text{const}\]</p>
<p>But by construction, \(K(M_k) &gt; k\) (that&rsquo;s what \(\min_{P_k(n)} n\) encodes a proof of). So we get
\[k &lt; K(M_k) &lt; \log k + \text{const}\]
which obviously can&rsquo;t hold if \(k\) is sufficiently large. So for \(k\) greater than
some constant \(L\), we run into a paradox &hellip; if any \(n\) encoding such a proof exists.
If there is no \(n\) encoding a proof that some specific bit string has complexity higher than
\(k\), then there is no smallest such \(n\), and we can&rsquo;t define \(M_k\). This proves
Chaitin&rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is some constant \(L\) such that for any given bit string, we can&rsquo;t prove
it has Kolmogorov complexity higher than \(L\).</p>
</blockquote>
